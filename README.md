# Description

Take pictures in Budibase! This component allows you to snap a photo directly into an Attachment field in a Budibase DB data source. It's a form field  component and it saves the captured image files directly to the attachment column you configure.

## Known issues

- doesn't currently work in Safari or Firefox. Chromium browsers only supported for now.

## Todos

- add camera selection
- add more options (timer, resolution, format, etc.)
- allow photo deletion from field
- wider browser support
